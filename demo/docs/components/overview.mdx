# Components Overview

This section demonstrates custom React components integrated with Mintlify documentation.

## Custom Components

We use custom React components to enhance the documentation experience with interactive elements and performance-optimized implementations.

## Performance Considerations

All custom components follow performance best practices:

- Memoization for expensive computations
- Callback optimization for event handlers
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Modular structure to prevent cascading re-renders
